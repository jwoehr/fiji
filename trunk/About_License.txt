About License

Today 2018-08-09 I have applied the GNU Public License (GPLv3) supplemented by
the Lesser Gnu Public License (LGPL v3). A user asked that I specifically
apply the LGPL so that he may incorporate FIJI in another work.

I applied both licenses as recommended by SourceForge's licensing pages. This
seems confusing to me, but I am not a lawyer. In any case, it is my express
intent that the more liberal provisions of the LGPLv3 be applied.

It is also my express intent that users be able to incorporate FIJI in other
works, open or commercial, within the limits of the LGPL, i.e., giving credit
and me retaining my copyright. Licensing is for me a means of retaining artistic
control and professional use of my work, rather than restricting others from
sharing that work by using it in their own professional pursuits.

Please use FIJI and enjoy, respecting the terms of the LGPL!
